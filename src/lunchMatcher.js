/*
Edit the function "LunchMatcher" that matches each person to people that could grab lunch with. 
For people to be matched they must be in the same city and share a favourite food.

lunchMatcher should format a sentence for each person stating who they can grab lunch with.

For example:
Mozelle Broxap can get lunch with Valle Brettel and Katusha Crumpe.

If a person does not match with anyone, lunchMatcher should say that they did not match with anyone

For example:
Carol-jean Tremmil does not have any lunch matches in their area.

The final output should show on the page to the right as follows:

Mozelle Broxap can get lunch with Valle Brettel and Katusha Crumpe.
Carol-jean Tremmil does not have any lunch matches in their area.
Lizabeth Ewert can get lunch with Enriqueta Dewitt.
Enriqueta Dewitt can get lunch with Lizabeth Ewert and Mallissa Gedling.
Valle Brettel can get lunch with Mozelle Broxap and Katusha Crumpe.
Katusha Crumpe can get lunch with Mozelle Broxap and Valle Brettel.
Mallissa Gedling can get lunch with Enriqueta Dewitt.
